      <h1>Notion templates built for real work</h1>
      <p>
        I've used Notion daily for the past two years to manage tasks, projects, and content. After trying lots of
        setups, I started building my own systems. Notion is a flexible all-in-one workspace for notes, tasks, projects, and knowledge. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Below are the templates I've built for different purposes.
