    A high level screening has been performed of UKCS oil fields to identify the most likely LSWF candidates utilising screening criteria with a focus on kaolinite clay content. The screening results suggest that approximately 57% of the fields have 6 % or higher kaolinite clay content. Of these fields 26 % were water-wet and 74 % were mixed-wet in terms of wettability. This suggests that a significant number of fields would fall within the eligibility for consideration of LSWF EOR although their suitability will depend on field maturity (current recovery factor and facilities constraints). The difficulty in applying LSWF in tertiary mode unlike secondary mode, is in obtaining a reasonable prediction of how the reservoir is likely to respond. The question of core availability and quality has been raised in a number of studies in terms of LSWF and electrical property testing. We propose a methodology which can be applied to compensate for the lack of usable core based on petrophysical log response. The logs can be utilised to determine the clay types present (including fractions) from which the cation exchange capacity can be calculated. Selected compositions from anonymised field data from core was used to provide quality control the log derived values. The most likely recovery mechanism, multi-component ion exchange (MIE), requires the input of key electrical properties into the models (cation exchange capacity, reactive surface area, activation energy and mineral fraction) in order to predict the response of the reservoir to LSWF. In this study the effect of clay content on the reservoir response was modelled indirectly by altering the cation exchange capacity relative to the clay mineral fraction present in the reservoir to determine its effect. Utilising a mechanistic modelling approach, homogeneous Cartesian models were run in the compositional finite difference reservoir simulator GEM to assess the impact on oil recovery. The simulated coreflood tests reveal that under secondary LSWF recovery was 68.4 % compared to 63.6 % for formation water (high salinity). The conservative nature of the relative permeability curves limited the incremental recovery. An analysis of the tertiary recovery utilising a coreflood based on Fjelde et al. (2012) revealed that cation exchange impacts the predicted recovery by up to 2.65 % OOIP for the range of 5 - 30 % clay content. Given that the recovery under tertiary conditions is considered in the literature to be between 6 and 12 %, this is significant and highlights that if idealised data is selected rather than real field data, then significant potential exists to under or over-predict the incremental recovery.
