The **SEG Open Seismic Datasets** collection provides publicly available seismic data released for education, benchmarking, and research by the Society of Exploration Geophysicists and partner organisations.

The datasets include 2D and 3D seismic surveys from a variety of geological settings, often accompanied by velocity models, interpretation products, and technical documentation. They are widely used for algorithm development, seismic processing workflows, and teaching.

Each dataset has its own usage terms and documentation, which should be reviewed prior to reuse.
