The **Geothermal Data Repository (GDR)** is the primary submission and access portal for geothermal energy-related research data funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO), hosted on the **Open Energy Information (OpenEI)** platform. The repository enables research, collaboration, and transparency by providing open access to a broad range of geothermal and subsurface datasets.

Users can browse and download **diverse geothermal datasets** — including heat flow measurements, reservoir characterisation, well logs, geophysical surveys, and project-specific studies — through an interactive search interface. The GDR aggregates contributions from many data providers and research projects, particularly those associated with DOE-funded work, but is not limited to U.S. data alone.

While the portal itself is free and does not require registration to view or download public datasets, some submissions may have specific access considerations or require agreeing to terms when downloading large packages of data. The repository provides documentation, submission guidelines, and metadata standards to support both data contributors and consumers.

Most metadata and dataset downloads on the GDR are available under **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0)** unless otherwise noted in the individual dataset metadata. 

The repository supports search and discovery across **thousands of datasets**, spanning geothermal exploration, modelling, resource characterisation, and technology testing — including projects such as Utah FORGE and other enhanced geothermal system initiatives.
