The Kansas Geological Society (KGS) provides access to a substantial collection of geological and subsurface data for the state of Kansas, USA. This dataset includes well and borehole metadata, well logs, core data, production records, and various geological reports. The data is primarily sourced from oil and gas exploration and production activities within Kansas, making it a valuable resource for researchers, geologists, and industry professionals interested in the region's subsurface characteristics.

The data can be accessed and downloaded through the KGS Petroleum Research Section's online portal. While registration is not required to access the data, users should review the specific terms of use provided on the KGS website, as the licensing details are not explicitly stated.

Searching for suitable data can be troublesome as there no filters for specific datasets, and it relies on you either downloading batches of LAS files or to look through individual wells.

Data also includes statisics on oil and gas wells in Kansas, which can be useful for historical analysis and research.

It is also actively being updated with new data as it becomes available from ongoing exploration and production activities in the region.
