The COSTA model is a synthetic, hierarchical carbonate reservoir model developed as a benchmarking case study for research and comparative analysis.

The dataset is designed to support reproducible testing of reservoir characterisation, modelling, and simulation workflows, particularly in the context of complex carbonate systems. It provides a controlled reference case rather than representing a real field or regulatory dataset.

As an academic benchmark, the COSTA model is best suited to method comparison, teaching, and research evaluation. It should not be interpreted as representative of real-world data completeness, uncertainty, or operational constraints typically encountered in industry or regulatory archives.
