Geoscience Australia provides a national open data portal offering geological, geophysical, and energy-related datasets covering both onshore and offshore Australia.

The portal includes a wide range of subsurface data products, with particular strength in regional seismic datasets, basin-scale geological models, and national syntheses. Well and borehole information is available but is typically less central than in European regulatory portals.

Datasets are accessed via web portals and download services, with most data openly available under Australian Government open licences. The data is well suited for regional studies, teaching, and contextual geological analysis, rather than field-scale machine learning benchmarking.
