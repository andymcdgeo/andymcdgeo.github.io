WAPIMS (Western Australian Petroleum and Geothermal Information Management System) is the primary portal for petroleum and geothermal subsurface data in Western Australia, operated by the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (DMIRS).

The portal provides access to well metadata, reports, seismic surveys, and production-related information for both onshore and offshore areas. Data is typically released after statutory confidentiality periods and becomes publicly accessible through the portal without registration.

Compared to national portals such as Geoscience Australia, WAPIMS is more operational and industry-focused, with detailed well-level documentation and strong coverage of offshore petroleum activity, particularly on the North West Shelf. Access workflows can be manual, with users often navigating individual well or survey records to locate available files.
