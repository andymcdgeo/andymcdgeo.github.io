The **UK NSTA Open Data** portal provides public access to petroleum-related subsurface and production information for the **United Kingdom onshore and offshore**, including the **UK Continental Shelf**. The portal is maintained by the North Sea Transition Authority (formerly the Oil and Gas Authority).

Available datasets include well and field metadata, production and injection statistics, seismic survey information, and a wide range of regulatory and technical reports. Much of the data is released following statutory confidentiality periods.

The data are widely used for basin studies, production analysis, regulatory reporting, academic research, and training. Access is provided through a central data centre with downloadable datasets and documentation.
