NLOG is the national portal providing information on energy and mineral resources in the deep subsurface of the Netherlands and the Dutch continental shelf (including oil, gas, geothermal). 

NLOG is public portal with interactive map/datacenter. Seismic surveys/lines can be downloaded via the interactive map or datacenter; if data can't be found, requests can be made (fees may apply for service-desk work). 

Boreholes have per-borehole detail pages; for some wells it's possible to download complete datasets, however, it is an entirely manual process as each well page needs to be searched to find the right files or extent of the data coverage. In general, most wells have metadata and reports available, as well as formation and wellbore profile information.
