The **International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP)** provides open access to scientific drilling data collected from ocean basins and continental margins worldwide. The programme supports fundamental research into Earth’s structure, climate history, geohazards, and geodynamic processes.

IODP datasets include borehole metadata, downhole logs, geophysical measurements, core descriptions, and extensive expedition reports. Data are curated and released through dedicated data portals and archives shortly after expedition completion.

IODP data are widely used in academic research, education, and method development across geoscience disciplines.
