The Volve Field Open Dataset is a comprehensive collection of subsurface, production, and operational data from the decommissioned **Volve oil field** in the **central Norwegian North Sea**. The field was discovered in 1993, produced from 2008 until 2016, and its data were released by Equinor and the Volve licence partners for research, training, and development purposes.

The dataset is one of the most complete open subsurface collections ever made publicly accessible, with **around 40,000 files** covering a wide range of data types. Content includes well logs, seismic surveys, production and injection histories, reservoir simulation and static models, and supporting documents and reports. 

Access is provided via Equinor’s **Volve data sharing page**, where the data can be downloaded directly. While registration is not required for access to the shared dataset page, the actual download availability may vary depending on Equinor’s maintenance status and hosting. 

The licence is based on a **modified Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY)** style arrangement that permits reuse and adaptation with attribution but contains restrictions on resale and coverage over all data elements (including those not covered by copyright).

Scientists, researchers, students, and technology developers routinely use this dataset for:
- reservoir engineering and simulation,
- seismic interpretation and processing,
- production analytics,
- machine learning and predictive modelling,
- training and educational projects
