**Utah FORGE (Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy)** is a U.S. Department of Energy flagship field laboratory dedicated to advancing **enhanced geothermal systems (EGS)** technology. The site is located near **Milford, Utah**, within a crystalline basement setting selected for controlled geothermal research and experimentation.

The dataset hosted via the **OpenEI Geothermal Data Repository (GDR)** provides open access to a wide range of **subsurface, drilling, stimulation, monitoring, and modelling data** generated as part of the FORGE programme. This includes detailed well metadata, well logs, geophysical and seismic surveys, geological and structural models, and extensive technical documentation supporting ongoing research activities.

Utah FORGE data are released progressively as experiments are completed and quality-checked. The portal allows users to browse individual submissions, each with detailed metadata describing acquisition methods, spatial coverage, and applicable licence terms. While the repository itself is publicly accessible without registration, individual datasets may include additional notes or conditions specific to their experimental context.

The dataset is widely used for:
- enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) research,
- fracture stimulation and monitoring studies,
- seismicity and microseismic analysis,
- geothermal reservoir characterisation,
- numerical modelling and machine learning research,
- academic training and method development.

Utah FORGE represents one of the most detailed **open geothermal research datasets** currently available and serves as a reference site for geothermal innovation globally.
