The **BGS Borehole Records** archive is the national repository for borehole and well information drilled onshore in the United Kingdom. Maintained by the British Geological Survey, it contains records spanning water, minerals, hydrocarbons, geothermal, and engineering investigations.

Data availability varies by borehole and includes metadata, scanned logs, lithological descriptions, and associated reports. Many records are accessible directly online, while others may require request-based access or have specific reuse conditions.

The dataset is widely used in geological modelling, groundwater studies, geotechnical investigations, and academic research.
