The same is true for the petrophysical domain and can often be referred to as the Log QC or data review stage of a project. It is at this stage that we begin to go through the data in detail and identify what data we really have, where we have it and what is the quality of the gathered data.</description></item><item><title>Petrophysics: Gamma Ray Normalization in Python</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-10-18-petrophysics-gamma-ray-normalisation-in-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-10-18-petrophysics-gamma-ray-normalisation-in-python/</guid><description>Normalization of well log data is a common and routine process within a petrophysical workflow and is used to correct for variations in logging curves between wells. These variations can arise due a number of different reasons such as incorrect tool calibrations, varying tool vintage and changes in borehole environmental conditions between the wells.
In this article we will go over:
