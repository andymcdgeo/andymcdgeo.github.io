They are a commonly used tool within petrophysical workflows for understanding the spread and distribution of data, and for picking key interpretation parameters such as shale or clay volume minimum and maximum values.</description></item><item><title>Reservoir Rock Typing Definitions</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-23-reservoir-rock-typing-definitions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-23-reservoir-rock-typing-definitions/</guid><description>A series of definitions for facies, rock typing and petrophysical groups.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Well Log Data Using the Welly Python Library</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-13-exploring-well-log-data-using-the-welly-python-library/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-13-exploring-well-log-data-using-the-welly-python-library/</guid><description>A look into a Python library dedicated to loading, exploring and plotting well log LAS files.</description></item><item><title>Public Datasets for Geoscience and Petrophysical Machine Learning</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-07-public-datasets-for-geoscience-and-petrophysics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-07-public-datasets-for-geoscience-and-petrophysics/</guid><description>Having open access to vast amounts of well log data used to be a challenge.

It is often considered the ‘ground truth’ by many and is used as a reference for calibrating well log measurements and petrophysical analysis. Core data is expensive to obtain and not acquired on every well at every depth. Instead, it may be acquired at discrete intervals on a small number of wells within a field and then used as a reference for other wells.</description></item><item><title>Porosity-Permeability Relationships Using Linear Regression in Python</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-11-01-exploratory-data-analysis-with-well-log-data/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-11-01-exploratory-data-analysis-with-well-log-data/</guid><description>Once data has been collated and sorted through, the next step in the Data Science process is to carry out Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This step allows us to identify patterns within the data, understand relationships between the features (well logs) and identify possible outliers that may exist within the dataset. In this stage, we gain an understanding about the data and check whether further processing is required or if cleaning is necessary.</description></item><item><title>Visualising Well Data Coverage Using matplotlib</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-10-26-visualising-well-data-coverage-using-matplotlib/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-10-26-visualising-well-data-coverage-using-matplotlib/</guid><description>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an integral part of Data Science. The same is true for the petrophysical domain and can often be referred to as the Log QC or data review stage of a project. It is at this stage that we begin to go through the data in detail and identify what data we really have, where we have it and what is the quality of the gathered data.</description></item><item><title>Petrophysics: Gamma Ray Normalization in Python</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-10-18-petrophysics-gamma-ray-normalisation-in-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-10-18-petrophysics-gamma-ray-normalisation-in-python/</guid><description>Normalization of well log data is a common and routine process within a petrophysical workflow and is used to correct for variations in logging curves between wells. These variations can arise due a number of different reasons such as incorrect tool calibrations, varying tool vintage and changes in borehole environmental conditions between the wells.
In this article we will go over:

Some of the common formats that we as petrophysicists work with include LAS, ASCII and CSV files. Many of these formats can easily be loaded into a Python script ot Jupyter Notebook.
Many months back, I put together a series of Jupyter Notebooks illustrating different ways of working with well log data.</description></item></channel></rss>
