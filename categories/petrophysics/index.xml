They are a commonly used tool within petrophysical workflows for understanding the spread and distribution of data, and for picking key interpretation parameters such as shale or clay volume minimum and maximum values.</description></item><item><title>Reservoir Rock Typing Definitions</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-23-reservoir-rock-typing-definitions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-23-reservoir-rock-typing-definitions/</guid><description>Using well log data to subdivide and group the subsurface into meaningful packages is a common task within geoscience and peterophysics. It allows log responses and rocks that exhibit similar responses and characteristics to be grouped together into what is known as facies.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Well Log Data Using the Welly Python Library</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-13-exploring-well-log-data-using-the-welly-python-library/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-13-exploring-well-log-data-using-the-welly-python-library/</guid><description>The welly library was developed by Agile Geoscience to help with loading, processing and analysing well log data from a single well or multiple wells. The library allows exploration of the meta data found within the headers of las files and also contains a plotting function to display a typical well log.</description></item><item><title>Public Datasets for Geoscience and Petrophysical Machine Learning</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-07-public-datasets-for-geoscience-and-petrophysics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-07-public-datasets-for-geoscience-and-petrophysics/</guid><description>Many years ago, it used to be the case that well log data was locked up on servers within the oil and gas companies and access was restricted to only a handful of people. It is only in recent years that vast amounts of well log and field data has become publicly available.</description></item><item><title>How to Use Unsupervised Clustering on Well Log Data</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-02-unsupervised-clustering-of-facies/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-02-unsupervised-clustering-of-facies/</guid><description>Understanding the subsurface lithology is an important task in geoscience and petrophysics. Using a variety of electrical measurements generated from well logging technology we are able to make inferences about the underlying geology, such as the lithology, facies, porosity, and permeability.</description></item><item><title>Loading Well Log Data From DLIS using Python</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-04-21-loading-well-log-data-from-dlis-using-python/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-04-21-loading-well-log-data-from-dlis-using-python/</guid><description>Introduction There are a number of different formats that well log and petrophysical data can be stored in. In the earlier articles and notebooks of this series, we have mainly focused on loading data from CSV files (here) and LAS files (here and here).</description></item><item><title>Adding Formation Data to a Well Log Plot</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-02-28-adding-formation-data-to-a-well-log-plot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-02-28-adding-formation-data-to-a-well-log-plot/</guid><description>Well log plots are a common visualization tool within geoscience and petrophysics. They allow easy visualization of data (for example, Gamma Ray, Neutron Porosity, Bulk Density, etc) that has been acquired along the length (depth) of a wellbore.
I have previously covered different aspects of making these plots in the following articles:</description></item><item><title>Loading Multiple Well Log LAS Files Using Python</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-02-14-loading-multiple-well-log-las-files-using-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-02-14-loading-multiple-well-log-las-files-using-python/</guid><description>Introduction Log ASCII Standard (LAS) files are a common Oil &amp;amp; Gas industry format for storing and transferring well log data. The data contained within is used to analyze and understand the subsurface, as well as identify potential hydrocarbon reserves. In my previous article: Loading and Displaying Well Log Data, I covered how to load a single LAS file using the LASIO library.</description></item><item><title>Porosity-Permeability Relationships Using Linear Regression in Python</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-12-28-porosity-permeability-relationships-using-linear-regression-in-python/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-12-28-porosity-permeability-relationships-using-linear-regression-in-python/</guid><description>Core data analysis is a key component in the evaluation of a field or discovery, as it provides direct samples of the geological formations in the subsurface over the interval of interest. It is often considered the ‘ground truth’ by many and is used as a reference for calibrating well log measurements and petrophysical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Porosity-Permeability Relationships Using Linear Regression in Python</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-11-01-exploratory-data-analysis-with-well-log-data/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-11-01-exploratory-data-analysis-with-well-log-data/</guid><description>Once data has been collated and sorted through, the next step in the Data Science process is to carry out Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This step allows us to identify patterns within the data, understand relationships between the features (well logs) and identify possible outliers that may exist within the dataset.</description></item><item><title>Visualising Well Data Coverage Using matplotlib</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-10-26-visualising-well-data-coverage-using-matplotlib/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-10-26-visualising-well-data-coverage-using-matplotlib/</guid><description>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an integral part of Data Science. The same is true for the petrophysical domain and can often be referred to as the Log QC or data review stage of a project. It is at this stage that we begin to go through the data in detail and identify what data we really have, where we have it and what is the quality of the gathered data.</description></item><item><title>Petrophysics: Gamma Ray Normalization in Python</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-10-18-petrophysics-gamma-ray-normalisation-in-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-10-18-petrophysics-gamma-ray-normalisation-in-python/</guid><description>Normalization of well log data is a common and routine process within a petrophysical workflow and is used to correct for variations in logging curves between wells. These variations can arise due a number of different reasons such as incorrect tool calibrations, varying tool vintage and changes in borehole environmental conditions between the wells.</description></item><item><title>Loading and Displaying Well Log Data from LAS Files with Python</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-08-30-loading-and-displaying-well-log-data-from-las-files-with-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-08-30-loading-and-displaying-well-log-data-from-las-files-with-python/</guid><description>Anyone who has worked or is currently working within the oil and gas industry will understand that there are a large variety of formats that well log data can be stored in. Some of the common formats that we as petrophysicists work with include LAS, ASCII and CSV files.</description></item></channel></rss>
