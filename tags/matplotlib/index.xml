      <description>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an integral part of Data Science. The same is true for the petrophysical domain and can often be referred to as the Log QC or data review stage of a project.

Some of the common formats that we as petrophysicists work with include LAS, ASCII and CSV files.</description>
