They are a commonly used tool within petrophysical workflows for understanding the spread and distribution of data, and for picking key interpretation parameters such as shale or clay volume minimum and maximum values.</description></item><item><title>How to Use Unsupervised Clustering on Well Log Data</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-02-unsupervised-clustering-of-facies/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-02-unsupervised-clustering-of-facies/</guid><description>Understanding the subsurface lithology is an important task in geoscience and petrophysics. Using a variety of electrical measurements generated from well logging technology we are able to make inferences about the underlying geology, such as the lithology, facies, porosity, and permeability.</description></item><item><title>Visualising Well Data Coverage Using matplotlib</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-10-26-visualising-well-data-coverage-using-matplotlib/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-10-26-visualising-well-data-coverage-using-matplotlib/</guid><description>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an integral part of Data Science. The same is true for the petrophysical domain and can often be referred to as the Log QC or data review stage of a project. It is at this stage that we begin to go through the data in detail and identify what data we really have, where we have it and what is the quality of the gathered data.</description></item><item><title>Loading and Displaying Well Log Data from LAS Files with Python</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-08-30-loading-and-displaying-well-log-data-from-las-files-with-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-08-30-loading-and-displaying-well-log-data-from-las-files-with-python/</guid><description>Anyone who has worked or is currently working within the oil and gas industry will understand that there are a large variety of formats that well log data can be stored in. Some of the common formats that we as petrophysicists work with include LAS, ASCII and CSV files.</description></item></channel></rss>
