Using a variety of electrical measurements generated from well logging technology we are able to make inferences about the underlying geology, such as the lithology, facies, porosity, and permeability.
Machine Learning algorithms have routinely been adopted to group well log measurements into distinct lithological groupings, known as facies. This process can be achieved using either unsupervised learning or supervised learning algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Loading and Displaying Well Log Data from LAS Files with Python</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-08-30-loading-and-displaying-well-log-data-from-las-files-with-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2020/2020-08-30-loading-and-displaying-well-log-data-from-las-files-with-python/</guid><description>Anyone who has worked or is currently working within the oil and gas industry will understand that there are a large variety of formats that well log data can be stored in. Some of the common formats that we as petrophysicists work with include LAS, ASCII and CSV files. Many of these formats can easily be loaded into a Python script ot Jupyter Notebook.
Many months back, I put together a series of Jupyter Notebooks illustrating different ways of working with well log data.</description></item></channel></rss>
