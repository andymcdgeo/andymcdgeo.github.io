When working on tutorial or training datasets it can be the case that they have been engineered in a way to make it easy to work with and allow the algorithm being discussed to be run successfully.</description></item><item><title>Visualising Well Data Coverage Using matplotlib</title><link>https://andymcdgeo.github.io/blog/2020-10-26-visualising-well-data-coverage-using-matplotlib/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andymcdgeo.github.io/blog/2020-10-26-visualising-well-data-coverage-using-matplotlib/</guid><description>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an integral part of Data Science. The same is true for the petrophysical domain and can often be referred to as the Log QC or data review stage of a project. It is at this stage that we begin to go through the data in detail and identify what data we really have, where we have it and what is the quality of the gathered data.</description></item></channel></rss>
