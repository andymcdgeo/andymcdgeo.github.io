It can be used to understand why some log responses may behave the way they do. This data may have been sourced from a previous mineralogical interpretation or from mud logs.
In my previous article: Enhancing Visualization of Well Logs With Plot Fills, we saw: how to apply fixed color fill between a curve and the edge of a track, how to apply a density-neutron crossover fill and how to apply a variable fill based upon the value of curve being plotted.</description></item><item><title>Displaying Logging While Drilling Image Data on a Well Log Plot Using Python</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-01-31-displaying-logging-while-drill-lwd-image-logs-in-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-01-31-displaying-logging-while-drill-lwd-image-logs-in-python/</guid><description>Borehole image logs are false-color pseudo images of the borehole wall generated from different logging measurements/tools. How borehole images are acquired differs between wireline logging and logging while drilling (LWD). In the wireline environment measurements are made from buttons on pads that are pressed up against the borehole wall and provide limited coverage, but at a high resolution. In contrast, in the LWD environment measurements are made from sensors built into tools that form part of the drillstring/tool assembly, and using the tool rotation, provide full 360-degree coverage.</description></item><item><title>Displaying Lithology Data on a Well Log Plot Using Python</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-01-27-enhancing-visualisation-of-well-logs-with-plot-fills/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-01-27-enhancing-visualisation-of-well-logs-with-plot-fills/</guid><description>Matplotlib is a great library to work with in Python and it is one that I always go back to time and time again to work with well logs. Due to its high degree of flexibility it can be tricky to get started with it at first, but once you have mastered the basics it can become a powerful tool for data visualization.
When working with well log data it can be common to apply color fills to the data to help quickly identify areas of interest.</description></item></channel></rss>
