The library allows exploration of the meta data found within the headers of las files and also contains a plotting function to display a typical well log. Additionally, the welly library contains tools for identifying and handling data quality issues.
The Welly library can be found at the Agile Geoscience GitHub at https://github.</description></item><item><title>Using the missingno Python library to Identify and Visualise Missing Data Prior to Machine Learning</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-09-missingno/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-06-09-missingno/</guid><description>Data exploration and pre-processing are important steps within any data science or machine learning workflow. When working on tutorial or training datasets it can be the case that they have been engineered in a way to make it easy to work with and allow the algorithm being discussed to be run successfully. However, in the real world, data is messy! It can have erroneous values, incorrect labels and parts of it can be missing.</description></item></channel></rss>
