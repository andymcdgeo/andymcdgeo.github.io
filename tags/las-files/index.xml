The library allows exploration of the meta data found within the headers of las files and also contains a plotting function to display a typical well log. Additionally, the welly library contains tools for identifying and handling data quality issues.
The Welly library can be found at the Agile Geoscience GitHub at https://github.</description></item><item><title>Loading Multiple Well Log LAS Files Using Python</title><link>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-02-14-loading-multiple-well-log-las-files-using-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andymcdonald.scot/blog/2021/2021-02-14-loading-multiple-well-log-las-files-using-python/</guid><description>Introduction Log ASCII Standard (LAS) files are a common Oil &amp;amp; Gas industry format for storing and transferring well log data. The data contained within is used to analyze and understand the subsurface, as well as identify potential hydrocarbon reserves. In my previous article: Loading and Displaying Well Log Data, I covered how to load a single LAS file using the LASIO library.
In this article, I expand upon that by showing how to load multiple las files from a subfolder into a single pandas dataframe.</description></item></channel></rss>
