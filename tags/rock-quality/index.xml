It allows log responses and rocks that exhibit similar responses and characteristics to be grouped together into what is known as facies. Once they are grouped together they can be used for further analysis, for example creating porosity-permeability transforms on a facies by facies basis.
Within the literature, many definitions exist for different methods of grouping the subsurface, and in some cases these have been used interchangeably.</description></item></channel></rss>
