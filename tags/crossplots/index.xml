It is often considered the ‘ground truth’ by many and is used as a reference for calibrating well log measurements and petrophysical analysis. Core data is expensive to obtain and not acquired on every well at every depth. Instead, it may be acquired at discrete intervals on a small number of wells within a field and then used as a reference for other wells.</description></item><item><title>Porosity-Permeability Relationships Using Linear Regression in Python</title><link>https://andymcdgeo.github.io/blog/2020-11-01-exploratory-data-analysis-with-well-log-data/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andymcdgeo.github.io/blog/2020-11-01-exploratory-data-analysis-with-well-log-data/</guid><description>Once data has been collated and sorted through, the next step in the Data Science process is to carry out Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This step allows us to identify patterns within the data, understand relationships between the features (well logs) and identify possible outliers that may exist within the dataset. In this stage, we gain an understanding about the data and check whether further processing is required or if cleaning is necessary.</description></item></channel></rss>
